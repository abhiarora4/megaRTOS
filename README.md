This RTOS is intended for Arduino Due. 
I initially started to make my own custom RTOS for Arduino Mega but i realised very soon preemptive scheduling wouldn't be good idea for 8 Bit-Controller.

Using this you can make your own projects with Due with Real Time performance.
I wanted to use it in AUV and UAV.
I will soon add good documentation and also post the results of my implementation.
